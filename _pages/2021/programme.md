## Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems

### Programme
This is the preliminary workshop programme (All timings are in CEST)

| Time          | Event                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 09:00–09:10 | **Opening** <br> Chairs: Anya Belz and Yvette Graham |
| 09:10–10:00 | **Invited Talk:** Disagreement in Human Evaluation: Blame the Task not the Annotators<br>by [Lucia Specia](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.specia), Imperial College London and University of Sheffield<br><em> It is well known that human evaluators are prone to disagreement and that this is a problem for reliability and reproducibility of evaluation experiments. The reasons for disagreement can fall into two broad categories: (1) human evaluator, including under-trained, under-incentivised, lacking expertise, or ill-intended individuals, e.g., cheaters; and (2) task, including ill-definition, poor guidelines, suboptimal setup, or inherent subjectivity. While in an ideal evaluation experiment many of these elements will be controlled for, I argue that task subjectivity is a much harder issue. In this talk I will cover a number of evaluation experiments on tasks with variable degrees of subjectivity, discuss their levels of disagreement along with other issues, and cover a few practical approaches do address them. I hope this will lead to an open discussion on possible strategies and directions to alleviate this problem.</em><br>**[[Video](https://youtu.be/cxyGsr3uBAM)]**    |

In this talk, I will work through the different factors involved in ethics-informed AI evaluation, including connections to ML training and ML fairness, and present an overarching evaluation protocol that addresses a multitude of considerations in developing ethical AI.</em><br>**[[Video](https://youtu.be/kThMRCMwvHc)]**    |
