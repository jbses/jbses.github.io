* February 15, 2022: Submission deadline for [ARR](https://aclrollingreview.org/)*
* February 28, 2022: Workshop paper due date (standard submissions via the [OpenReview Workshop Portal](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2022/Workshop/HumEval))

*In addition to standard submissions, submissions which were previously submitted to ARR and reviewed there can be committed to the workshop (together with the reviews) not later than 22 March 2022. We suppose that all papers submitted to ARR until 15 February 2022 will be reviewed by 22 March (see [ARR timeline](https://aclrollingreview.org/dates)), however we cannot guarantee it because it depends on ARR editors and not on us.
